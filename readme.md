# Offensive Whacker

Offensive Whacker (OW!) is created as part of an ICT2206 Assignment 1. This is an offensive tool created to automate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks as well as scan for vulnerabilities. The purpose of the creation of this tool is to allow users to use an all in one tool to perform their XSS attacks without the need of switching programs as well as to allow users who are less experienced to use our pre-made XSS code which reduces the time spent on researching and creating payload as this component continuously scans the siteâ€™s URL field and injects a large list of pre-written XSS codes into it.
